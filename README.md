# leaflet-challenge
## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## File Organization and Structure
Located in the parent directory are three folders and the index.html file
The Leaflet-Part-1 folder contains a js folder that houses the config.js and the logic.js files for part one of the challenge
The Leaflet-Part-2 folder contains a js folder that houses the logic2.js file for part two of the challenge
The css folder contains the style.css file for styling of the map
